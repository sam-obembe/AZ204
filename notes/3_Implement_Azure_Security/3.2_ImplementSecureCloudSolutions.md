There are two service tiers:
* Standard
* Premium : includes HSM protected keys

Authenticating to key vault can be done through : 
* Managed identities : recommended

* Service principal and secret

# 2. Develop code that uses keys, secrets, and certificates stored in Azure Key Vault


# 3. Implement Managed Identities for Azure resources
