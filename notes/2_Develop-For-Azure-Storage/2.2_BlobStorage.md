# 2.2 Develop solutions for Azure Blob Storage

## **Blob storage resources**
* Storage account
* Container (i.e folder)
* Blob
    * **Block blobs** : stores text and binary data up to 4.7TB
    * **Append blobs** : made of blocks optimised for append operations
    * **Page blobs** : store random access files up to 8TB. Store Virtual Hard Drive(VHD) files that provide disk storage for Azure VMs. 

***

## **Storage Security Features**
* All data(and metadata) is encrypted using **Storage Service Encryption(SSE)**
* Azure AD and RBAC are supported for resource management operations and data operations
* Data can be secured in transit using Client-Side encryption, HTTPS or SMB 3.0
* OS and data dasks can be encrypted using **Azure Disk Encryption**

### Azure storage encryption
* Uses 256-bit AES encryption
* Is FIPS 140-2 compliant
* Is enabled for all new and existing accounts and can't be disabled. Applies to all tiers and deployment models.
* No additional cost

## **Storage redundancy options**

### Primary region redundancy
* Data in an Azure storage account is always replicated 3 times
* There are two options for replication:
    * **Locally redundant storage (LRS)**
        * Copies data synchronously within a single physical location
        * Least expensive
        * Not recommended when high availability or durability are required
    * **Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)**
        * Copies data synchronously across three availability zones in the primary region

### Secondary region redundancy
There are two options:
* **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)**
    * Copies data asynchronously to a physical location in the secondary region
    * Replicatets data in secondary location using LRS
* **Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)**
    * Copies data using ZRS then copies data aynchronously to a single location in the secondary region, then copies it using LRS.

## **Interact with data using the Azure SDK**

There are two .NET SDKs
* Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Blob
* Azure.Storage.Blobs

The process for copying files between storage accounts and subscriptions
1. Create a blob service client instance for each storage account
2. Create a reference for each container
3. Create a blob reference for each blob item (source & destination)
4. Delete the source item

If another process is trying to write to a file that's being moved, an error is thrown. To prevent this, we can utilise **Leases**. A **lease** can be in one of five states : 
* Available
* Leased
* Expired
* Breaking
* Broken

## **Implementing Data archiving and retention**

The available access tiers are : 
* Hot
* Cool : for less frequently accessed data and stored for at least 30 days
* Archive : for rarely accessed data and stored for at least 180 days. Only available at blob level
