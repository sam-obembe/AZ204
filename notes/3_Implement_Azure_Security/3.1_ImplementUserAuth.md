# 1. Authenticate and Authorize Users Using Microsoft Identity Platform
Microsoft identity platform can be used to : 
    * build apps that allow users to sign in using Microsoft identities or social accounts
    * provide authorized access to APIs or Microsoft APIs

The components of Microsoft identity platform are : 
* OAuth 2.0 & OpenID Connect standard-compliant auth service : Allows different authentication types :
    * Work/School accounts through Azure Active Directory
    * Personal microsoft account (skype, xbox, outlook)
    * Social or local accounts using Azure Active Directory B2C
* Open-source libraries : Microsoft Authentication Libraries (MSAL)
* Application management portal
* Application configuration API & PowerShell

It also allows
* Passwordless authentication
* Step-up authentication
* Conditional Access

## Service principals
Applications must be registered with an Azure Active Directory tenant so Azure Active directory can handle identity and access management.
When applications are registered, an **application object** and **service principal object** are automatically created in the home tenant.

### Application Object
* There is only one application object
* Used as a template to create one or more service principal objects.
* A service principal is created in every tenant where the apaplication is used
* The application object describes : 
    * How the service can issue tokens
    * Resources that the application can access
    * Actions the application can perform

### Service principal object
There are three types of service principal
* Application : It's the local representation of a global **application object**. It defines who can access the app, what resources the app can use, what the app can do in each tenant.
* Managed identity : Used to represent a 'managed identity'. These provide an identity for apps to use when connecting to resources that support Azure Active Directory.
* Legacy : Represents legacy apps created before app registrations. Can only be used in the tenant where it was created. 


## Permissions and Consent

### Permission types
* Delegated permissions : used by apps that have a signed-in user
* Application permissions: used by apps without a signed-in user e.g background services


### Consent Types
* Static user consent
    - must specify all the needed permissions in the App configuration in Azure portal
    - enables admins to consent on behalf of all users in an organisation
    
    **Issues**
    - app needs to request all the permissions it would ever need on the first sign-in
    - app needs to know all the resources it would ever access ahead of time

* Incremental and dynamic user consent
    - can request permissions incrementally
    - only applies to [**Delegated permissions**](#permission-types) and not [**application permissions**](#permission-types)

* Admin consent
    - required for access to high-privilege permissions
    - gives admins additional control over app and user authorization
    - when done on behalf of an organisation, static permissions are still required


## Conditional access
Offers :
* Multifactor authentication
* Restricting user locations and IP ranges
* Allowing only Intune enrolled devices to access specific services

### Impacts on applications
These scenarios require code to handle Conditional access challenes
* Apps performing the on-behalf-of flow
* Apps accessing multiple services/resources
* Single-page apps using MSAL.js
* Web apps calling a resource



# 2. Authenticate and Authorize Users and applications using Azure Active Directory

## Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL)
* Can be used to provide secure access to Microsoft Graph, Microsoft APIs, third party APIs and personal APIs
* Supports .NET, JavaScript, Java, Python, Android & iOS

### Benefits of MSAL
* No need for direct use of OAuth libraries
* Acquires tokens on behalf of a user or an appplication
* Maintains token cache and handles token expiration and refreshing


### Application client types
* Public client applications : 
    * Run on devices, desktops or in browsers. 
    * Not trusted to keep application secrets safe and only access web APIs for the user. 
    * Don't hold configuration-time secrets
* Confidential client applications
    * Run on servers
    * Difficult to access and can keep application secrets
    * Can hold configuration-time secrets
    * Each instance has distinct client ID and client secret.

**Initialize client applications**
On .NET 3.1+, we can use `PublicClientApplicationBuilder` and `ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder`. The app will need to be registered before initializing it. 


# 3. Create and Implement shared access signatures
* Shared access signature (SAS) : A URI that grants restricted access rights to Azure Storage resources

There are three types of SAS:
* User delegation SAS
    * Applies to **Blob storage** only
    * Secured with Azure Active Directory credentials and SAS specified permissions
* Service SAS
    * Secured with the storage account key
    * Delegates access to a resource in Blob storage, Queue storage, Table storage or Azure Files
* Account SAS
    * Secured with the storage account key
    * Can do all the operations Service and Uses SAS does

## **How SAS works**
An SAS is made up of a URI and a token. The token's components are
* `sp=r` : defines access rights, `a` = add, `c` = create, `d` = delete, `l` = list, `r` = read, `w` = write
* `st=2020-02-01T00:00:00Z` : when access starts
* `se=2020-02-01T00:00:00Z` : when access ends
* `sv=2020-02-01` : version of storage API to use
* `sr=b` : kind of storage to use
* `sig=SrW1HZ5Nb6MbRzTbXCaPm%2BJiSEn15tC91Y4umMPwVZs%3D` : cryptographic signature

### **Best practices**
* Always use HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
* User delefation SAS is the most secure and should be used as much as possible
* Set the expiration time to be the smallest useful value
* Apply minimum-required privileges. Only grant required access levels and nothing more
* If an SAS isn't the correct solution, create a middle tier service

## Stored access policies
Provides additional control over service-level SAS's on the server side. It groups SASs and can provide restrictions on those SASs. The supported resources are : 
* blob containers
* file shares
* queues
* tables

# 4. Implement Solutions that interact with Microsoft Graph
