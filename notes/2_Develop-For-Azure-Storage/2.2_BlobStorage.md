# 2.2 Develop solutions for Azure Blob Storage

## **Blob storage resources**
* Storage account
* Container (i.e folder)
* Blob
    * **Block blobs** : stores text and binary data up to 4.7TB
    * **Append blobs** : made of blocks optimised for append operations
    * **Page blobs** : store random access files up to 8TB. Store Virtual Hard Drive(VHD) files that provide disk storage for Azure VMs. 

***

## **Storage Security Features**
* All data(and metadata) is encrypted using **Storage Service Encryption(SSE)**
* Azure AD and RBAC are supported for resource management operations and data operations
* Data can be secured in transit using Client-Side encryption, HTTPS or SMB 3.0
* OS and data dasks can be encrypted using **Azure Disk Encryption**

### Azure storage encryption
* Uses 256-bit AES encryption
* Is FIPS 140-2 compliant
* Is enabled for all new and existing accounts and can't be disabled. Applies to all tiers and deployment models.
* No additional cost

***

## **Storage redundancy options**

### Primary region redundancy
* Data in an Azure storage account is always replicated 3 times
* There are two options for replication:
    * **Locally redundant storage (LRS)**
        * Copies data synchronously within a single physical location
        * Least expensive
        * Not recommended when high availability or durability are required
    * **Zone-redundant storage (ZRS)**
        * Copies data synchronously across three availability zones in the primary region

### Secondary region redundancy
There are two options:
* **Geo-redundant storage (GRS)**
    * Copies data asynchronously to a physical location in the secondary region
    * Replicatets data in secondary location using LRS
* **Geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)**
    * Copies data using ZRS then copies data aynchronously to a single location in the secondary region, then copies it using LRS.


***

## **Implementing Data archiving and retention**

The available access tiers are : 
* Hot : for frequently accessed data
    * Can be set at the account level
    * Support all redundancy options
* Cool : for less frequently accessed data and stored for at least 30 days
    * Can be set at the account level
    * Support all redundancy options
* Archive : for rarely accessed data and stored for at least 180 days. Only available at blob level
    * Stored offline
    * Only supports LRS, GRS and RA-GRS

### Data lifecycle
Azure blob storage life cycle management allows
* Blob transitioning to cooler tiers
* Blob deletion at the end of their lifecylces
* Rule definition for process to be run daily at the storage account level
* Apply rules to containers or subsets of blobs

### Lifecycle policies
A policy is a collection of rules in JSON document. 
The main rule filter options are `blobTypes`, `prefixMatch` and `blobIndexMatch`. 
The rule actions included `tierToCool`, `enableAutoTierToHotFromCool`,`tierToArchive`,`delete` . If more than one action is defined for a blob, the least expensive action is chosen. s
```
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "ruleFoo",
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": [ "blockBlob" ],
          "prefixMatch": [ "container1/foo" ]
        },
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30 },
            "tierToArchive": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 90 },
            "delete": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 2555 }
          },
          "snapshot": {
            "delete": { "daysAfterCreationGreaterThan": 90 }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Specify policy through the cli
```
az storage account management-policy create \
    --account-name <storage-account> \
    --policy @policy.json \
    --resource-group <resource-group>
```

### Rehydrate blob data from archive tier
* Archived blobs are 'offline' and can't be read
* To read data in archived blobs, they must be rehydrated to an online tier(hot/cool)
* Rehydration can take several hours

The options for rehydrating are :
* Copy to an online tier (recommended)
  * Supported only in the same storage account
  * Must be copied to a new blob with a different name
* Change the blob's access tier
  * Need to call **Set Blob Tier**
  * The **Set Blob Tier** request cannot be cancelled

The levels of rehydration priority are : 
* Standard priority
* High priority

## **Interact with data using the Azure SDK**

There are two .NET SDKs
* Microsoft.Azure.Storage.Blob
* Azure.Storage.Blobs (Recommended)

### Azure.Storage.Blobs classes
* BlobClient
* BlobClientOptions
* BlobContainerClient
* BlobServiceClient
* BlobUriBuilder

### File and container operations
* See `sampleProjects/az204-blob`

The process for copying files between storage accounts and subscriptions
1. Create a blob service client instance for each storage account
2. Create a reference for each container
3. Create a blob reference for each blob item (source & destination)
4. Delete the source item

If another process is trying to write to a file that's being moved, an error is thrown. To prevent this, we can utilise **Leases**. A **lease** can be in one of five states : 
* Available
* Leased
* Expired
* Breaking
* Broken

### Managing container properties and metadata
Blob containers support:
* System Properties
* User-defined metadata

Metadata names are case-insensitive when being read or set. A `400 (Bad Request)` when a request to write with multiple instances of the same name is sent. 

Metadata values can only be read or written in full. 

**Retrieving container properties with dotnet sdk**
On the `BlobContainerClient` class, call `GetProperties` or `GetPropertiesAsync`.


**Setting container properties with dotnet sdk**
On the `BlobContainerClient` class, call `SetMetadata` or `SetMetadataAsync`.
