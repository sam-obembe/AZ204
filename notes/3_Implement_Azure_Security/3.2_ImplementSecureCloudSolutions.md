# 1. Secure app configuration data by using App Configuration or Azure Key Vault
Azure Key Vault is a cloud service for securely storing and accessing secrets. There are two types of containers:
* Vaults : store software and HSM backed keys, secrets and certificates
* Managed hardware security modules (HSM) pools : only support HSM backed keys

Azure key vault handles
* Secret management
* Key management
* Certificate management

There are two service tiers:
* Standard
* Premium : includes HSM protected keys

Authenticating to key vault can be done through : 
* Managed identities : recommended
* Service principal and certificate
* Service principal and secret

# 2. Develop code that uses keys, secrets, and certificates stored in Azure Key Vault


# 3. Implement Managed Identities for Azure resources
Managed identites are used by applications to connect to resources that support Azure Active Directory and obtain AD tokens. Internally they are a special type of service principal that can only be used with Azure resources.

**Types of managed identities**
* System-assigned managed identity
    * enabled directly on an azure service instance
    * lifecycle is tied to the azure service instance and is deleted when the instance is deleted
* User-assigned managed identity
    * created as a standalone resource and assigned to one or more azure service instances
    * lifecycle is managed separately from the service instance

### Create a VM with a system-assigned managed identity
```
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup \ 
    --name myVM --image win2016datacenter \ 
    --generate-ssh-keys \ 
    --assign-identity \ 
    --role contributor \
    --scope mySubscription \
    --admin-username azureuser \ 
    --admin-password myPassword12
```

### Enable system-assigned managed identity on an existing VM
```
az vm identity assign -g myResourceGroup -n myVm
```

### Create a user assigned identity
```
az identity create -g myResourceGroup -n myUserAssignedIdentity
```


### Assign a user-managed identity during creation of a VM
```
az vm create \
--resource-group <RESOURCE GROUP> \
--name <VM NAME> \
--image UbuntuLTS \
--admin-username <USER NAME> \
--admin-password <PASSWORD> \
--assign-identity <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY NAME> \
--role <ROLE> \
--scope <SUBSCRIPTION>
```


### Assign user-assigned managed identiy to existing azure VM
```
az vm identity assign \
    -g <RESOURCE GROUP> \
    -n <VM NAME> \
    --identities <USER ASSIGNED IDENTITY>
```



# Azure App Configuration
App configuration is used to store application settings in one place. It complements Azure Key Vault.

Requirments for customer-managed key capability
* Standard tier azure app configuration instance
* Azure key vault with enabled soft delete and purge protection
* An RSA or RSA-HSM key in the key vault
